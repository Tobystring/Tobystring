            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>Posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
            <p>This week i am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you 
            submerge the food (usually <br>vaccum-sealed in a plstic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature
            you want the food to be cooked to. In his book. <br><em>Cooking for Greeks</em> Jeff Potter describes it as <q>Ultra-low-temperature 
            poaching.</q></p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</strong> To reserve a seat at the chef table, 
            contact us before November 30.</p>
            <p>Location:<br>Baker's corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
            <p>Hours: <br>Tuesday to Sunday, 11am to 11pm</p>
